Hi, I'm Xavier, a multidisciplinary professional navigating the convergence of finance, statistics, and information systems. My career is defined by a refusal to be pigeonholed into a single discipline; I am simultaneously a Statistician, an Economist, and a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Currently, I am expanding my technical horizons by studying Information Systems at UTEQ, driven by the conviction that the future of financial oversight lies in robust, data-driven architectures. I am passionate about uncovering the mathematical logic behind complex systems, whether they are market fluctuations, auditing algorithms, or musical compositions.

# My research interests

My intellectual curiosity is deeply rooted in **Applied Mathematics and Operations Research**. I am fascinated by the potential of mathematical programming languages, such as AMPL, to solve intricate optimization problems in logistics and finance. Beyond the traditional scope of economics, I have a profound interest in **Algorithmic Music and Computational Arts**. I actively explore the intersection of art and code, utilizing tools like **Pure Data** for real-time graphical programming and **LilyPond** for automated music engraving. My goal is to investigate how stochastic processes—typically used for risk modeling—can be repurposed to generate expressive, non-deterministic musical structures, bridging the gap between rigid statistical models and creative fluidity.

# My background and history

My academic journey has been rigorous and diverse, characterized by a pursuit of excellence that crosses borders. I earned my **Master’s degree in Statistics and Operations Research** from the **Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)** in Barcelona, Spain. This was a pivotal period in my career, made possible after I was awarded a competitive scholarship based on academic merit, which allowed me to specialize in advanced quantitative methods in Europe.

Prior to my specialization in data science, I built a strong foundation in the financial sector. I hold a **Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Auditing**, which granted me the CPA designation, and a degree in **Economics**. This dual background gave me years of experience in financial auditing, tax compliance, and regulatory frameworks. However, I realized that traditional methods were often insufficient for modern data volumes. This drove me to transition towards computer science and programming. Today, I combine my domain expertise in tax and finance with modern technical skills in Python, R, and Linux systems. I have also dedicated time to academia, teaching courses on Operations Research and Statistics, where I strive to help students visualize the powerful narrative hidden within raw data.
