Hi, I'm Xavier.

I am a **Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Auditor, and Economist** with a strong background in quantitative methods. I hold a **Master's in Statistics and Operations Research** from UPC.

My professional interests lie at the intersection of:

* **Financial Auditing & Taxation:** Applying rigorous analysis to fiscal compliance.
* **Information Systems & Data Science:** Leveraging technology to modernize risk assessment and decision-making.
* **Law & Economics:** Understanding regulatory frameworks in Civil and Common Law systems.

On this website, I document my journey combining these fields, sharing projects on applied mathematics, programming, and financial analysis.
